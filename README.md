# Template

This repo is a template for bootstraping new projects in late 2023.
It's built on top of Next.js 13, with TailwindCSS, Jest and React Testing Library, and ESLINT with import-order plugin and rules.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
